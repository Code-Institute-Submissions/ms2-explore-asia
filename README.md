# Explore Asia 
This website was designed to help people gain knowledge about countries in Asia. The site is designed to be helpful in planning a holiday by
providing key information about the countries. Users have a way of looking for flights, of receiving information about restaurants and 
information about key attractions. The site can be interacted with by the user, allowing them to select which content they wish to read. 

The deployed site can be viewed [here.](https://ellyc20.github.io/ms2-explore-asia/)

### 2.Scope 

### 3.Structure 

### 4.Skeleton 

The wireframes for this project can be viewed [here](https://github.com/EllyC20/ms2-explore-asia/tree/master/assets/wireframes/ms2-wireframes).

### 5.Surface 

**Colours**

**Font**

* The header font chosen is "Amatic Sc", the body font is "Raleway". I chose them as they pair very well together, a mix between a modern style header and a 
more traditional body text. 

**Images** 

* The main image I chose was due to the quality of the photo and the black and white feauture. The image represents a part of life in South East Asia, the 
focus being on markets in this image. Immediately the user can "see Asia" and what they might encounter on their visit. 

## Features 

### Current Features 

* A fixed Navbar, ensuring the user access to the menu at all points.
* A single scrolling page, allowing ease of use to the user.
* An interactive map, where the user chooses the destination via a button and is shown this location on the map. 
* The abilty to edit content, when the user selects a button the site is changed. The image image shown in about changes to reflect the users choice, as 
does the data shown. 
* The email feauture allows emails to be sent to the site owner. 

### Feautures To Be Implemented 

* An option to allow users to sign up for a monthly newsletter, that would provide up to date information regarding deals on hotels and flights.
